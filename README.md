                  This project focuses on performing end-to-end SQL-based data analysis on a synthetic
                  healthcare dataset. It includes comprehensive querying to extract patient, hospital,
                  treatment, and insurance insights From understanding patientdemographics
                  to ranking hospitals and medical conditions, the project highlights
                  how SQL can derive actionable intelligence in healthcare analytics.


‚ùì Problem Statement

                  Healthcare providers and policy makers require insights into patient 
                  data to optimize resources, improve patient care, and manage costs. This project aims to:

                  Analyze hospitalizations and billing trends

                  Identify high-risk patients and care patterns

                  Track common medical conditions and treatment paths

                  Rank hospitals, insurance providers, and blood type distributions
